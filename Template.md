## EFFICIENCY CLASS DEFINITIONS:

### Class 1 - Speed Chess

Speed chess is a variant of chess where players have to make quick decisions. The strategy is not about making perfect moves, but about making decisions that are fractionally better than your opponent's. Speed is more important than perfection.

Quick Decisions: The need to make moves within a short time frame.
Fractionally Better Moves: The goal is not perfection, but outperforming the opponent.
Speed Over Perfection: Fast, good-enough decisions are more valuable than slow, perfect ones.
Time Management: Effective use of limited time is crucial.
Adaptability: Ability to quickly adjust strategy based on the opponent's moves.
### Class 2 - Quality

This class emphasizes the importance of precision, thoroughness, and high standards in execution. Unlike Speed Chess where quick decisions are paramount, Quality Focus class values well-thought-out plans and actions that prioritize excellence and accuracy.

Attention to Detail: Prioritizing thoroughness and accuracy in every action.
Strategic Planning: Long-term planning and careful consideration of each move.
Excellence Over Speed: Focusing on the highest quality of work, even if it requires more time.
Consistency: Maintaining a high standard of performance throughout.
Risk Management: Minimizing errors and potential negative outcomes through careful analysis.
### Class 3 - Game Theory Model
This class involves strategic decision-making based on the analysis of competitorsâ€™ actions and potential outcomes. It's about continuously assessing situations and making the most optimal decisions based on the available information and predictions about others' behaviors.

Continuous Assessment: Regularly evaluating all aspects of the environment and the actions of other players.
Predictive Analysis: Anticipating the moves of others based on current and past behaviors.
Collaborative Strategy: Working towards common goals.
